## Welcome to Toad 

Toad is an open source, fun and lightweight  programming language with dynamic semantics.
It is simple and easy to learn which doesn't require any compilation.
Toad is inspired from python and runs on Java Runtime Environment. 
Toad packages core programming features like flow control, functions, high level constructs like objects and closures. 

### Getting started 
Try Toad out just by downloading the lastest release.
After downloading the `Toad.jar` file, create a new text file `sampleToadCode.txt` for a test run. 
Make sure you have java runtime installed. 

Open the terminal in the same directory and type the following : `java -toad.jar sampleToadcode.txt`

This command will interpret and run the code written in `sampleToadCode.txt`.
La voil√†, we have the outputted result in the terminal.

### Contributing to Toad
Contributions to Toad are welcomed and encouraged! 

There are many corners in Toad which need to sharpening. Please let me know of any bugs or errors which I might be oblivious of, I'll try to improve them.
Any additions like libraries or data-structures are welcomed and appreciated.
Download the source files and make improvements to the code and put a pull request.
